2. User is prompted for length of password, choosing a length between 8 & 128 characters

3. User is  asked for character types to include in the password and confirms  whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

4. User is prompted to select at least on character type.

5. When all prompts are answered; a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
